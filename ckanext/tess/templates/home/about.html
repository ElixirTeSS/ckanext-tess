            TeSS (ELIXIR Training eSupport System) is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.elixir-europe.org/">ELIXIR's</a> training portal,
            developed by <a href="http://www.elixir-uk.org/">ELIXIR-UK</a>, for discovering, packaging and linking
            training resources aggregated from the plethora of fragmented training resources in life sciences. The training resources are provided
            by various ELIXIR nodes across Europe and other training providers world-wide.
        </p>
        <p>
            New technologies are generating huge amounts of life sciences data that scientists now need to transform into new discoveries.
            The problem is that very few researchers have all the right skills to take advantage of this sudden data bonanza.
        </p>
        <p>
            As part of the pan-European <a target="_blank" href="http://www.elixir-europe.org/">ELIXIR project</a>, <a href="http://www.elixir-uk.org/">ELIXIR-UK</a> is responding to this
            challenge by taking a UK and European lead in training research scientists in computing, statistics and bioinformatics.
            By plugging the skills gap we aim to strengthen science across Europe, and will set the agenda for training needs in the future.

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>No. The TeSS is an aggregator of ELIXIR-relevant training information,
                        harvested from individual ELIXIR Nodes and from third-party training content providers.

                        <p>
                        TeSS does not store training materials itself, rather it stores links to original
                        training materials and also enables users to create their own <a href="/group">packages</a>
                        and <a href="/workflows">workflows</a> of (linked) materials to suit their needs.

                        TeSS harvests training information from ELIXIR Nodes and from 3-rd providers, and aggregates that
                        information according to different ‘views’ (e.g., ELIXIR overview versus Node-specific) -
                        it does not store training materials locally. The GOBLET Training Portal acts a repository of materials
                        and courses, and provides a catalogue of and trainers and course organisers. The primary focus of the TeSS
                        is on ELIXIR resources and Nodes; the principal focus of GOBLET is on its subscribed members and their
                        materials/courses.

                        <p>
                        Training information is brought into TeSS from various content providers automatically using their APIs (or, where these
                        do not exist, can be scraped automatically from providers’ websites).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        If you would like your content provider to be added to TeSS,
                        please contact the TeSS team so we can arrange a scraper for your site. Alternatively, all of these can be manually added and curated
                        by registered users.

                        Registered users can add a content provider manually from <a href="/organization">content providers page</a>, by clicking
                        the 'Add content provider' button. They will be presented with a form to
                        write a short description, upload the provider's logo and provide a link to provider's website.

                        Alternatively, content provider can be added automatically from a script at the time of ingesting training material content from that provider.

                        by clicking the 'Add training material' button. They will be presented with a multi-step form to

                        Alternatively, training material can be added automatically from a script ingesting training material from a particular content provider.
                        Typically, such a script would use the content provider's API, if such exists, or TeSS development team writes a script that scrapes
                        the training materials off provider's website.

                    <p>
                        This is a two step process. Firstly, you have to create, say, a package from the <a href="/group">packages</a> pages.
                        Secondly, you have to add an existing training material to that package (note that one training material can belong to
                        several packages and/or workflows). This is done by navigating to the page of that particular training material, then
                        selecting the 'Packages' tab, and selecting the appropriate package from a drop-down list.

        <h2>Software</h2>
        <p>
            TeSS is implemented by extending the <a href="http://ckan.org">CKAN platform</a>, an Open Source Data Portal software.
        </p>
        <p>
            TeSS is populated automatically by scraping content providers for their training materials. Both the TeSS Portal and all the scraping/aggregation
            scripts are open source and are released under the GPL license.
            The source code be found in <a href="https://github.com/ElixirUK">GitHub</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
         Please note that the TeSS at present is in pre-alpha state (as of 21th January 2015). Our first official alpha release is scheduled for the 30th March 2015.
