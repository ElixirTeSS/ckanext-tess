      <p>
          ELIXIR is a pan-European research infrastructure.
          It consists of the Hub and a number of ELIXIR nodes. Each participating node has a head of node, a training co-ordinator, and a technical co-ordinator.
          You can add a new node here if your country has signed the declaration to join ELIXIR. Please be very thorough with the information you provide.
