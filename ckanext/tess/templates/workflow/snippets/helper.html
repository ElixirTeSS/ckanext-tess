            Training workflow is a visual representation of a collection of training materials that can help
            navigating through the available resources specific to your research and training needs.

        </p>
        <p>
            For example, you can use workflows to represent a step-by-step breakdown of typical stages of some kind of
            data analysis (e.g., a protein sequence analysis pipeline, structure analysis protocol, etc.), where each node
            in the workflow represents an analysis step and links to the relevant training resources.
