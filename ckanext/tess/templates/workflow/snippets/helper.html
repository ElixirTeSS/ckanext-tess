            Training workflow is a visual representation of a collection of training materials. Workflows represent
            one way of navigating through the training materials available in TeSS, as workflow nodes represent links
            to training materials.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, you can use workflows to represent teaching courses or complex training flowcharts that people can
            follow in order to learn about a particular analysis.
